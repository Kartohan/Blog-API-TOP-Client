# Blog API | TOP Project | Client

This is the Client Page for the project Blog API.
This part of project is made in ReactJS.

The goal of this Blog API project was to create a blog, create a server that will control the flow of the blog, and create a content manager.

[Assignment from TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api)

What libraries did I use for the CMS:

1. ReactJS | React-router-dom
2. Axios
3. TailwindCSS | Flowbite | Flowbite-React | React Icons
4. Vite

I am very happy that I was able to complete this project. It was a long journey. Although not everything in this project seems to me complete, but the main thing is that everything works, and I was finally able to create the first full stack application. Thanks "The Odin Project" for that!

There is only one problem left, it is necessary to get rid of the HashRouter and configure the work of the client part without it.
