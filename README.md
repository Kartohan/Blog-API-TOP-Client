# Blog API | TOP Project | Client

This is the Client Page for the project Blog API.
This part of project is made in ReactJS.

The goal of this Blog API project was to create a blog, create a server that will control the flow of the blog, and create a content manager.

[Assignment from TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api)

What libraries did I use for the CMS:

1. ReactJS | React-router-dom
2. Axios
3. TailwindCSS | Flowbite | Flowbite-React | React Icons
4. Vite

I am very happy that I was able to complete this project. It was a long journey. Although not everything in this project seems to me complete, but the main thing is that everything works, and I was finally able to create the first full stack application. Thanks "The Odin Project" for that!
